# Project Agent Log: MVP - Multiplayer Low-Poly FPS Arena

This document tracks the development progress and outlines the immediate and long-term goals for the project.

## Current Status (As of last update)

We have successfully built a functional prototype that includes both single-player mechanics and the foundational layer for multiplayer gameplay.

### Core Mechanics Implemented:
-   **Player Controller:** A first-person character controller with:
    -   Standard WASD movement and mouse-look for aiming.
    -   Physics including gravity and jumping.
-   **Combat System (Prototype):**
    -   Instant "hitscan" (raycast-based) shooting, triggered by a left-click.
    -   Visual feedback for shots, including a crosshair and red hit-marker planes.
    -   Destructible target cubes placed in the scene for testing.
-   **Environment:**
    -   A simple, bounded plane for the arena floor.
    -   Basic lighting.

### Multiplayer Networking Implemented:
-   **Client-Server Architecture:**
    -   A Node.js server using Express and Socket.IO is running.
    -   The Next.js client successfully connects to the server via a `useSocket` hook.
-   **State Synchronization:**
    -   The client continuously sends its position and rotation data to the server.
    -   The server broadcasts this data to all other connected clients.
    -   Clients render other players as simple blue cuboids, updating their positions and rotations in real-time.

## What We Are Trying To Do Now (Immediate Goals)

The current focus is to transition from a technical prototype to the game loop defined in the project specification.

1.  **Implement the Lobby System:** This is the highest priority.
    -   Create the UI for a player to enter their name before joining the game.
    -   Update the server to manage player names and game states (Lobby, In-Round).
    -   Establish the "Contestant" vs. "Spectator" logic based on connection order.
2.  **Display Player Names:** Implement the system to render player names as text floating above each character model in the 3D scene.
3.  **Introduce Health & Defeat:**
    -   Give each player Health Points (HP).
    -   Make player-on-player shots decrease HP.
    -   Handle player defeat when HP reaches zero (removal from the map, transition to spectator).
